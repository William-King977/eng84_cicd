# Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment with Jenkins

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
* Plan/Design
* Develop
* Test
* Deploy

Problems with traditional SDLC
* Scale and complexity
  * Functions
  * Architecture
  * Infrastructure
  * Developers
  * Operations
* Manual and slow process
* Broken communication
* Human errors
* Large volume of testing
* Long deployment window
* High cost

DevOps in SDLC
* DevOps came to help modern SDLC - Agile
  * Collaboration
  * Automation

DevOps Life Cycle Stages
* Continuous Development
* Continuous Testing
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery/Deployment
* Continuous Monitoring

Continuous Integration (CI)
Practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
* Development
* Testing
* Integration

Continuous Delivery (CDE)
Where teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually.

Continuous Deployment (CD)
It's automated. Difference between CDE and CD.

Pipeline phases
1. Commit 
2. Build
3. Automate tests
4. Deploy

Why CI/CD matters:
* Reduce cost
* Faster release rate
* Smaller code changes
* Fault isolations
* More test reliability
* Increase team transparency and accountability
* Easy maintenance and updates

DevOps helps:
* Culture
* People/teams
* Collaboration
* Principles
* Automation tools
* SDLC
* System quality
* Cost efficiency
* Business value
