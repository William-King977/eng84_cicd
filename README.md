# Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment with Jenkins
## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
### Stages
* Plan/Design
* Develop
* Test
* Deploy

### Problems with traditional SDLC
* Scale and complexity
  * Functions
  * Architecture
  * Infrastructure
  * Developers
  * Operations
* Manual and slow process
* Broken communication
* Human errors
* Large volume of testing
* Long deployment window
* High cost

### DevOps in SDLC
* DevOps came to help modern SDLC - Agile
  * Collaboration
  * Automation

## CI/CD
### Continuous Integration (CI)
Practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
* Development
* Testing
* Integration

### Continuous Delivery (CDE)
Where teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so **manually**.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
Same as CDE, but deployment is automated.

### Pipeline phases
1. Commit 
2. Build
3. Automate tests
4. Deploy

### Why CI/CD matters
* Reduce cost
* Faster release rate
* Smaller code changes
* Fault isolations
* More test reliability
* Increase team transparency and accountability
* Easy maintenance and updates
